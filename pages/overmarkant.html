                        Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic
                        Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering
                        fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers
                        to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the
                        seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

                        Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these
                        doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining
                        the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery.
                        It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses,
                        and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee
                        culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked
                        on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.

                        Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California,
                        Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first
                        store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades,
                        we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric
                        of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are
                        always dedicated to Our Mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person,
                        one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.

                        It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – from the farmers who tend to
                        the red-ripe coffee cherries, to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean,
                        and to the barista who serves it with care. We are committed to the highest standards
                        of quality and service, embracing our heritage while innovating to create new experiences
